    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Passionate as heck web developer. I'm actually OBSESSED with coding.
      Typing stuff is so fun! Seeing it all turn into computer magic is really
      satisfying - and enamors me more and more by the day. This page, for
      example, how does it read all this content? How does a bunch of zeroes and
      ones turn into this scientific beauty? I eager to find out.
